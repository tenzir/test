# 🧪 tenzir-test

Welcome to the testing harness for the Tenzir ecosystem: it discovers `.tql` scenarios and Python fixtures, prepares the execution environment, and reports results tailored to pipeline authoring workflows.

## 🚧 Status

Work in progress as we prepare the framework for its first PyPI release. Expect rapid iteration until v1.0 ships.

## 🏃 TL;DR

1. Create a project root directory and initialize it:
   ```sh
   uv add tenzir-test
   ```
2. Add test scenarios, inputs, and fixtures.
3. Run the test harness:
   ```sh
   tenzir-test
   ```
See [the documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed usage instructions and [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) for contributor workflows.
