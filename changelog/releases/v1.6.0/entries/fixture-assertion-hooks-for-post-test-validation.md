Fixtures can now define assertion hooks that run after test execution completes while fixtures remain active. Define assertions using the `assertions` parameter with a frozen dataclass type, then pass fixture-specific assertion payloads under `assertions.fixtures.<name>` in test frontmatter. The framework automatically invokes the `assert_test` hook with assertion data before tearing down fixtures, letting you validate side effects like HTTP requests or log output.

Example usage with an HTTP fixture:

```yaml
fixtures: [http]
assertions:
  fixtures:
    http:
      count: 1
      method: POST
      path: /api/endpoint
      body: '{"key":"value"}'
```

The HTTP fixture receives the typed assertion payload and validates that the expected request was received. Payload structure is fixture-defined, so fixtures can choose flat fields or nested schemas as needed.

Assertion checks are tracked separately from test counts in the run summary as pass/fail check metrics, so fixture-level validations are visible without changing total test counts.
