This release adds suite-level capability requirements, letting test suites declare required operators and skip gracefully when those capabilities are unavailable in the target build.

## 🚀 Features

### Suite-level capability requirements and conditional skipping

Test suites can now declare operator dependencies with a `requires` configuration key in `test.yaml`. When a required operator is unavailable in the target Tenzir build, you can gracefully skip the suite by pairing `requires` with `skip: {on: capability-unavailable}`.

The `skip.on` key now accepts either a single condition as a string or a list of conditions, letting you skip on either `fixture-unavailable` or `capability-unavailable` (or both). When a capability is unavailable and the suite doesn't opt into skipping, the test run fails with a clear error message listing the missing operators.

Example configuration in `test.yaml`:

```yaml
requires:
  operators: [from_gcs, to_s3]
skip:
  on: capability-unavailable
  reason: requires from_gcs and to_s3 operators
```

This ensures test suites targeting specific capabilities only run when those capabilities are present, improving test reliability in heterogeneous build environments.
