This release adds structured configuration options for fixtures, letting tests pass typed parameters through YAML frontmatter using frozen dataclasses.

## 🚀 Features

### Structured options for fixtures

Fixtures can now receive typed configuration options passed from test YAML files.

Declare options on a fixture with `@fixture(options=MyDataclass)`, where `MyDataclass` is a frozen dataclass. Tests can then provide structured options in their frontmatter using either compact syntax (for simple cases) or expanded syntax (for clarity):

```yaml
fixtures:
  - node:
      tls: true
      port: 8443
  - http:
      port: 9090
```

The `@fixture` decorator validates that option keys match the dataclass fields, and the fixture retrieves its typed instance using `current_options(name)`. When options aren't provided, fixtures receive a default-constructed instance of their options class.

The feature maintains backward compatibility with the existing `fixtures: [node, http]` syntax for fixtures without options.
