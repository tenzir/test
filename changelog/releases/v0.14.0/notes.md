This release introduces inline test inputs for better test organization in deeply nested hierarchies. Tests can now place input data directly alongside test files, and you can create local `inputs/` directories at any level with automatic shadowing semantics.

## 🚀 Features

### Inline test inputs and local inputs directories

The test harness now supports inline test inputs for better test organization in deeply nested test hierarchies.

Tests can now place input data directly alongside test files using the `.input` extension. The harness automatically sets the `TENZIR_INPUT` environment variable pointing to `<test>.input` when the file exists. This makes test dependencies immediately visible without requiring you to navigate to a distant `inputs/` directory.

Additionally, you can now create `inputs/` directories at any level in the test hierarchy. The harness walks up from each test and uses the nearest `inputs/` directory for `TENZIR_INPUTS`, with shadowing semantics where nearer directories take precedence. This lets you organize shared test data close to the tests that use it.

The resolution hierarchy for `TENZIR_INPUTS` is:

1. `inputs:` override in test frontmatter or `test.yaml` (highest priority)
1. Nearest `inputs/` directory walking up from the test
1. Package-level `tests/inputs/` directory
1. Project-level `inputs/` directory (fallback)

All existing tests continue to work with the global `inputs/` directory.
