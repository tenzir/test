title: Automatic Binary Detection
intro: >-
  This release introduces automatic binary detection with a clear precedence order:
  environment variables take priority, followed by PATH lookup, with `uvx` as fallback.
  Environment variables now support multi-part commands for full control over binary
  invocation. The `--tenzir-binary` and `--tenzir-node-binary` CLI flags have been
  removed in favor of environment variables.
